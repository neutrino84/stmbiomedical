              p Our consultants are experts in GCP compliance. We work with organization to implement a quality management system that ensures a quality clinical trial. The Trial Master File (TMF) is a collection of documentation that demonstrates the trial was conducted to the study plan and in compliance with GCP. A poorly managed TMF puts an organization at risk during a regulatory inspection.  Just in Time GCP works with your team to ensure inspection readiness.
